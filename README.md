# word-graph
WordGraph Analysis is a Spring Boot REST API with API endpoints (JSON) to create and analyze graphs  from user submitted text using various graph algorithms. 
The adjacency list for the graph is generated by filtering the top N words from a text by frequency, dividing the text into sentences, and forming edges between words in the graph based on the number of times they occur in the same sentence. 
This graph is saved to a MongoDB NoSQL database and fetched when required to analyze it using various graph algorithms.

## Algorithms used:
1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Prim's algorithm to find MST (both Minimum and Maximum Spanning Tree)
4. Kruskal's algorithm to find MST (both Minimum and Maximum Spanning Tree)
5. Dijkstra's algorithm to find Single Source Shortest Paths (inverse weights also possible)
6. Floyd Warshall's algorithm to find All Source Shortest Paths (inverse weights also possible)

More algorithms to be covered in the future.
